                    <p>
                        Cinque Terre is mentioned in documents dating to the 11th century. Monterosso and Vernazza were settled first 
                        and the other villages grew later, whilst within the territory of the Republic of Genoa. In the 16th century,
                        the inhabitants reinforced existing forts and built new defence towers to defend the area from attacks by the Turks.
                         Cinque Terre experienced an economic decline from the 17th to 19th centuries,[citation needed] recovering when an
                          arsenal was built in La Spezia and it gained a railway link to Genoa.

                            The largest town of the Cinque Terre, Monterosso al Mare (often called simply Monterosso), is alternatively 
                            called the liveliest and the least charming of the five famous villages. It's the northernmost town in the chain,
                             making it a logical base for visitors arriving from the north and set to explore the Cinque Terre. The town is
                              divided into two partsâ€”the old town and the new town, also called Fegina. These two halves are connected by a
                               tunnel used by pedestrians and the few cars that enter and exit the town.

                                Vernazza (Ligurian: Vernassa, locally Vernasa; Latin: Vulnetia) is a town and comune located in the province 
                                of La Spezia, Liguria, northwestern Italy. It is one of the five towns that make up the Cinque Terre region.
                                 Vernazza is the fourth town heading north, has no car traffic, and remains one of the truest "fishing villages"
                                  on the Italian Riviera. It is the only natural port of Cinque Terre and is famous for its elegant houses.

                                    Manarola may be the oldest of the towns in the Cinque Terre, with the cornerstone of the church, 
                                    San Lorenzo, dating from 1338. The local dialect is Manarolese, which is marginally different from 
                                    the dialects in the nearby area. The name "Manarola" is probably a dialectical evolution of the Latin,
                                     " Magna rota". In the Manarolese dialect, this was changed to "Magna roea" which means "large wheel",
                                      about the mill wheel in the town.

                        <p>
                            Corniglia is a frazione within the comune of Vernazza in the province of La Spezia, Liguria, 
                            northern Italy with a population of about 150. Unlike the other localities of the Cinque Terre, 
                            Corniglia is not directly adjacent to the sea. Instead, it is on the top of a promontory about 100 metres high,
                             surrounded on three sides by vineyards and terraces, the fourth side descends steeply to the sea.
